# Nathan's Personal Website (Flutter Version)

# What

This project is my personal website written in Google's Flutter and using accompanying resources such as Firebase hosting. It is intended to be an alternate, more "fun", version of my resume for employers, friends, and really anyone who is interested in me and what I do, to view. Hopefully you came here by clicking on the "view the source code" section from mywebsite. If not, why not check it out at: https://NathanCheshire.com
